Phase 5: Message Broker Enhancement

Agent Role: Message Queue System Specialist

Primary Objectives:
1. Improve reliability and efficiency of message handling.
2. Implement error recovery for connection issues.
3. Track messages to ensure successful delivery.

Tasks and Instructions

Task A: Enhance Message Broker
Goal: Increase resilience with retry logic and delivery confirmation.

1. Update src/communication/broker.py to include retry logic with `AMQPConnectionError` handling.
   ```python
   def _connect_with_retry(self):
       for attempt in range(self.retry_count):
           try:
               self._connect()
               return
           except AMQPConnectionError:
               if attempt == self.retry_count - 1:
                   raise ConnectionError("Failed to connect after retries")
   ```

2. Add `send_message_with_confirmation` for delivery tracking.
   ```python
   def send_message_with_confirmation(self, message):
       try:
           self.channel.confirm_delivery()
           self.channel.basic_publish(..., mandatory=True)
           return True
       except Exception as e:
           return False
   ```

Verification Checklist
- [ ] Retry Logic Verified: Test connection recovery functionality.
- [ ] Message Confirmation Implemented: Confirm messages reach their target.

Summary: Phase 5 focuses on improving message reliability, adding retries, and tracking message delivery.
