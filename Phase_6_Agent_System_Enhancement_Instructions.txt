Phase 6: Agent System Enhancement

Agent Role: Agent Architecture Specialist

Primary Objectives:
1. Establish lifecycle management for agents.
2. Implement monitoring for performance insights.
3. Extend agent capabilities for robust task handling.

Tasks and Instructions

Task A: Enhance Base Agent
Goal: Provide agents with state tracking and monitoring capabilities.

1. Update src/roles/base_agent.py to include a MetricsCollector for tracking initialization and processing times.
   ```python
   def process_message(self, message):
       start_time = datetime.now()
       try:
           result = self._handle_message(message)
           self.metrics.record_metric('processing_time', (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds())
       except Exception as e:
           self.metrics.record_event('message_failure')
           return None
   ```

Verification Checklist
- [ ] Agent Lifecycle Enhanced: Confirm agents handle tasks efficiently and log performance metrics.

Summary: Phase 6 strengthens the agent system with state tracking, error handling, and performance metrics.
