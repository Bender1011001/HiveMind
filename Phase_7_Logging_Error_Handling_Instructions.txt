Phase 7: Logging and Error Handling

Agent Role: System Reliability Specialist

Primary Objectives:
1. Implement centralized logging across the system.
2. Add error recovery mechanisms to enhance resilience.
3. Ensure system reliability through robust error handling.

Tasks and Instructions

Task A: Implement Centralized Logging
Goal: Create a logging setup to capture all key events across modules.

1. Create src/utils/logging_setup.py with logging configuration.
   ```python
   def setup_logging(name, log_dir="logs"):
       logger = logging.getLogger(name)
       logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
       log_file = os.path.join(log_dir, f"{name}.log")
       handler = RotatingFileHandler(log_file, maxBytes=10_485_760, backupCount=5)
       logger.addHandler(handler)
       return logger
   ```

Verification Checklist
- [ ] Centralized Logging Confirmed: Ensure consistent logging behavior across modules.

Summary: Phase 7 sets up logging and error recovery to maintain system stability and visibility into errors.
