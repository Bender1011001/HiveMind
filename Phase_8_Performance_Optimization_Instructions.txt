Phase 8: Performance Optimization

Agent Role: System Performance Specialist

Primary Objectives:
1. Optimize system resource use and improve response times.
2. Implement caching and monitoring strategies.
3. Track performance metrics for ongoing optimization.

Tasks and Instructions

Task A: Implement Performance Monitoring
Goal: Track CPU, memory, and I/O usage to identify bottlenecks.

1. Create src/utils/performance_monitor.py for monitoring system metrics.
   ```python
   class PerformanceMonitor:
       def collect_metrics(self):
           self.metrics['cpu'].append(psutil.cpu_percent())
           self.metrics['memory'].append(psutil.virtual_memory().percent)
       def report(self):
           return {metric: max(values) for metric, values in self.metrics.items()}
   ```

Verification Checklist
- [ ] Performance Monitoring Setup: Confirm the monitor collects accurate metrics.

Summary: Phase 8 focuses on performance tracking and optimizations to enhance responsiveness and resource efficiency.
