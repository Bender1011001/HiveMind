**HiveMind: Project Overview**
The project aims to modify the LangChain framework to enable collaboration between multiple large language models (LLMs). This modification will allow different LLMs to work together on complex tasks using shared memory, inter-agent communication, a shared work directory, and code execution tools. The primary objective is to make these models seamlessly collaborate, leveraging their unique strengths in a coordinated environment.

**Project Scope**
The following features and modifications are required to achieve the project goal:

### 1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - **Repository Clone**: Clone the LangChain repository from GitHub to create a local version for modification.
   - **Virtual Environment**: Set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, including LangChain, database drivers (e.g., for MongoDB or Redis), and any message queue tools like RabbitMQ.
   - **VS Code Configuration**: Configure the VS Code environment for easy development, including necessary extensions for Python and Docker.

### 2. **Shared Memory and Database**
   - **Centralized Memory Store**: Implement a centralized memory system using MongoDB or Redis to store and share data between LLMs.
   - **Memory Schema Design**: Create a memory schema to define how contextual data (e.g., conversation history, task progress) will be stored, tagged, and retrieved by different models.

### 3. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol**
   - **API-Based Communication Layer**: Develop an API-based communication protocol to facilitate inter-agent collaboration. This layer should allow LLMs to share outputs, request assistance, and receive responses from each other.
   - **Task Coordination System**: Integrate a task management system using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to coordinate which model handles different parts of a task. This helps prevent redundancy and ensures efficiency.

### 4. **Dynamic Role Assignment**
   - **Role Management**: Implement a dynamic role management feature that assigns tasks to specific LLMs based on their capabilities. For instance, one model might specialize in creative writing, while another handles technical information.
   - **Capability Register**: Develop a capability register that logs each model's strengths, helping to automate the role assignment process for efficient task management.

### 5. **Shared Context and Memory Sharing**
   - **Shared Contextual Embeddings**: Create a shared contextual embedding system using a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or FAISS) to store past interactions and allow efficient similarity-based retrieval of relevant context.
   - **Context Summarization Module**: Develop a context summarization module that generates periodic summaries of ongoing tasks, ensuring all LLMs are up-to-date without the need to access full conversation histories.

### 6. **Shared Work Directory and Code Execution Tools**
   - **Shared Work Directory**: Set up a shared work directory using a cloud storage solution like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, allowing LLMs to share files and outputs.
   - **Code Execution Environment**: Integrate a code execution environment using Docker-based containers or Jupyter Notebooks to allow real-time code execution, debugging, and validation.

### 7. **Feedback Loop and Clarification Requests**
   - **Clarification Request Feature**: Implement a feature where LLMs can ask each other for clarifications, especially in cases where additional context is needed to complete a task.
   - **Quality Scoring System**: Develop a scoring system where LLMs evaluate each other's responses, providing iterative feedback to ensure continuous quality improvement.

### 8. **User Interface Integration**
   - **Basic UI Development**: Create a simple user interface using Gradio or Streamlit to interact with the multi-LLM system. This UI should allow users to initiate tasks, view model interactions, and evaluate results.

**Key Deliverables**
- A modified LangChain framework that supports multiple LLMs collaborating effectively.
- Centralized memory and shared work directory for context sharing.
- A communication layer for inter-agent coordination using an API and message queue.
- Integrated code execution environment for real-time collaboration.
- Basic user interface for interaction with the LLM system.

**Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Memory Store**: MongoDB or Redis
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone or FAISS
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Kafka
- **UI Framework**: Gradio or Streamlit
- **Code Execution**: Docker-based containers or Jupyter Notebooks
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage

**Notes for the Developer**
- The focus is on making the system functional without concern for documentation or extensive testing at this stage.
- Use modular coding practices to allow future refinement and testing phases.
- The user interface should be minimal but functional, allowing interaction with core features.
