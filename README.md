# HiveMind: Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration System

A local implementation of a multi-agent system that enables collaboration between multiple large language models (LLMs) through shared memory, communication, and workspace.

```

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start required services:
- MongoDB (for shared memory)
- RabbitMQ (for inter-agent communication)

3. Run the application:
```bash
python launcher.py
```

## Shared Workspace

The system uses a local shared workspace (`workspace/` directory) that contains:

- `code/`: Shared directory for code files created and executed by agents
- `data/`: Shared directory for data files used by agents
- `output/`: Shared directory for output files generated by code execution

This local workspace enables agents to:
- Share code and data files
- Access outputs from other agents' code executions
- Maintain persistent storage of shared resources

## Core Features

1. **Shared Memory**
   - MongoDB-based centralized memory store
   - Allows agents to share data and context

2. **Inter-Agent Communication**
   - RabbitMQ-based message broker
   - Enables direct communication between agents

3. **Code Execution**
   - Secure code execution environment
   - Supports Python and JavaScript
   - Saves code and outputs to shared workspace

4. **Role Management**
   - Dynamic role assignment based on agent capabilities
   - Task coordination between agents

## Configuration

System settings can be configured through:
1. Environment variables
2. Configuration file (`src/settings/config.json`)
3. UI settings panel

Key configuration options:
- Model settings (name, API key, temperature)
- Service connections (MongoDB, RabbitMQ)
- Workspace paths

## Usage

1. Launch the application using `python launcher.py`
2. Access the UI at `http://localhost:8501`
3. Use the interface to:
   - Create and manage tasks
   - Register and configure agents
   - Monitor inter-agent communication
   - Execute code
   - Adjust system settings

## Development

The system is designed for local development with:
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Local workspace for simplified file sharing
- Basic UI for system interaction
- Integrated logging for debugging
